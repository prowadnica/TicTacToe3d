The popular Tic-Tac-Toe game. The detachable lid allows it to be easily carried, and the small size will make it fit in any pocket.
The set consists of a game board (3 by 3 fields), a lid and 9 pawns. The pawns have a cut circle on one side and a cross on the other, which allows them to perform a double function. The shapes are very easy to feel.
